CISC 3130 Storage for Lab 4

Using Java, I imported data from multiple CSV files(7-09.csv", "7-16.csv", "7-23.csv", "7-30.csv", "8-06.csv", "8-13.csv", "8-20.csv", "8-28.csv", "9-03.csv", "9-10.csv", "9-17.csv", "9-24.csv", "10-1.csv") that collectively contains songs from the Spotify Top 200 weekly charts of Q3(July, August, September) in the United States. Disregarding duplicate entries on the multiple Top 200 weekly charts throughout Q3, there are a total of 420 songs. 

To create organization, I removed duplicate entries and used the GUI to create a media player that allows the user to "listen" to the current track, add the current track to a final playlist, skip the current track, or cancel the playlist creation. To view the listening history of the Q3 songs, the user will be able to access this information through a text file("ListeningHistory.txt"). To view the final playlist, the user will be able to access this information through a text file("FinalPlaylist.txt"). The two text files("FinalPlaylist.txt" & "ListeningHistory.txt") that have been uploaded to GitHub are just an example execution of the program and results may vary depending on the user.
